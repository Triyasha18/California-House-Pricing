Regression-in-Machine-Learning
Objective:
 The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.
 
Linear_Regression is a simple and widely used algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that predicts the target variable based on the input features.

Decision Tree Regressor is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for regression tasks. It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

Gradient Boosting Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion. It optimizes arbitrary differentiable loss functions.

Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is a type of regression algorithm based on the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It is used to predict continuous numerical values.
