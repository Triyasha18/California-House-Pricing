## Regression-in-Machine-Learning
### Objective:
 The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.
 
### Linear_Regression
Linear_Regression is a simple and widely used algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that predicts the target variable based on the input features.

### Decision Tree Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for regression tasks. It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

### Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion. It optimizes arbitrary differentiable loss functions.

### Support Vector Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is a type of regression algorithm based on the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It is used to predict continuous numerical values.

### why it might be suitable for this dataset.
Each regression algorithm has its strengths and can be suitable depending on the dataset’s characteristics. 

Linear Regression is ideal for simple, linear relationships and small datasets due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Decision Tree Regressor captures non-linear relationships and is easy to interpret, making it suitable for datasets with complex patterns. 
Random Forest Regressor offers robustness and insights into feature importance, handling non-linear relationships well. 

Gradient Boosting Regressor provides high accuracy by sequentially correcting errors, making it suitable for complex, non-linear relationships. 

Support Vector Regressor (SVR) handles non-linearity and outliers effectively, performing well on small datasets with complex relationships. 

Each algorithm’s suitability depends on the specific data and problem at hand
